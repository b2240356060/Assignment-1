My name is Zafer Bincan. I am a computer engineering student at Hacettepe University and I am 19 years of age. My interest in science, math and computers is why I chose to study computer engineering. My other interests are chess, table tennis and football.

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; I will not share my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
